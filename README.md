# Genetic Algorithm for Traveling Salesman Problem

This repository provides a code for implementing a vanilla genetic algorithm for solving traveling salesman problem. The algorithm is equipped with three trivial-but-effective genetic operators: roulette wheel for creating a mating pool, single-point crossover, and swap mutation.
Note that this code is intented for illustration purpose, all the algorithm parameters are decided arbitrarily.
